<div class="content">
		<p >
			Our Project Stroke is based on heart stroke prediction since
			 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd 
			 leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% 
			 of total deaths. This project is based on the concept to predict 
			 whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters
			  like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. 
			  This website will give you a detailed explanation regarding heart stroke, 
			  what all symptoms you will get, how it is caused and the prevention steps 
			  that you can take to stay healthy or if it is too serious then what all treatments 
			  are recommended for it. As we all know to live a healthy life you should know your
			   risk and what all healthy lifestyle you can follow to stay fit. Our website and project
			    can help you to build a powerful prevention plan with your health care team 
				(doctors, nurses, pharmacists, registered dietitians, and other professionals).

<h2 class="sub-h">Analysis of our dataset</h2>
		<div class="content">
            <p>The data contains 5110 observations with 12 attributes. 
			This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely 
			to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, 
			various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides 
			relavant information about the patient.</p><br>

<h2 class="sub-h">Platform Used</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>We have analysised and predicted our dataset on anaconda software 
			which is an open-source distribution for python and R. It is used for 
			data science, machine learning, deep learning, etc. With the availability 
			of more than 300 libraries for data science, it becomes fairly optimal for
			 any programmer to work on anaconda for data science.The Anaconda distribution 
			 comes with packages that can be used on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The individual
			  edition includes popular package names like numpy , pandas , scipy , sklearn , 
			  tensorflow , pytorch , matplotlib and more.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In anaconda we have basically used Jupyter notebook application for our back end to
				 predict the chances of stroke for a person. The Jupyter Notebook application allows
				 you to create and edit documents that display the input and output of a Python or
				 R language script. Once saved, you can share these files with others.</p>

<h2 class="sub-h">Algorithm Implemented</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>we have used many algorithms for our prediction like SVM, Linear reggression, 
				Naive baye's, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN...etc to predict and analysis our data.
				 By far there are 2 algorithms which provides the best accuracy for our dataset, they 
				 are as folllows:</p>
		<div><br>
			<ul class="ul">
			<li>Neccesary libraries Imported:- numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot</li>
			<li>Dependent attribute: stroke</li>
			<li>Independent attribute: gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status</li>
			<li>Test size: 0.1</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
		   <ol class="algo">
			<li>Desicion Tree</li>
			<br>
			<p>Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and 
				Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. 
				It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset,
			    branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.In a decision tree, 
				for predicting the class of the given dataset, the algorithm starts from the root node of the tree. 
				This algorithm compares the values of root attribute with the record (real dataset) attribute and, 
				based on the comparison, follows the branch and jumps to the next node.For the next node, the algorithm 
				again compares the attribute value with the other sub-nodes and move further. It continues the process 
				until it reaches the leaf node of the tree. The criteria we have used here is entropy.</p>
			<br>
			<pre class="score">Accuracy Score: 0.9706457925636007 (97%)</pre>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>Random Forest</li>
			<br>
			<p>Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised 
			learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML.
			 It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple 
			 classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.
			 Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets 
			 of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
			 " Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree 
			 and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output.
			 Random Forest works in two-phase first is to create the random forest by combining N decision tree,
			  and second is to make predictions for each tree created in the first phase. The criteria we have used
			   here is entropy, random_state is 22, n_estimators=3</p>

<h2 class="sub-h">Outcome of our project</h2>
    <div class="content">
    	<p>So the total outcome of our analysis and prediction 
		is to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke
		 based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases,
		 and smoking status. In our result we have clearly explained the role 
		 of each parameter on the stroke in our website and here through our 
		 analysis we have explained our result through graphs.</p>

			<li>People who are living in rural area are more likely to experience less number of heart strokes as compared to the people living in urban areas many factors can be there to predict this type of result like pollution, unhygienicness etc</li>

			<li>Males are more likely to experience less number of heart strokes as compared to the females many factors can be there to predict this type of result like pregnancy, high blood pressure etc</li>
