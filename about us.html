      Our website is a trusted source for reliable health information and
      wellness guidance. Our mission is to empower individuals with the
      knowledge and tools they need to make informed decisions about their
      health and well-being. Along with this our website also predict about
      various illness and diseases the person is suffering from by using our
      prediction model. For this, we gather relevant medical data for predicting
      various diseases. This could include factors like age, gender, blood
      pressure, cholesterol levels, family history, smoking habits, diabetes
      status, etc, then pass it to the deployed machine learning model via the
      API. Receive the prediction response and display it to the user.

      <h2 class="sub-h">About our project</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Me Rashmi Gourh and my friend Riya Dubey together worked on this
          project which tells predictions based on some input parameters like
          gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Here we have mainly
          worked on heart stroke prediction since according to the World Health
          Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally,
          responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This project is
          based on the concept to predict whether a patient is likely to get a
          stroke or not. This website will give you a detailed explanation
          regarding heart stroke and other various illnesses, what all symptoms
          you will get, how it is caused, and the prevention steps that you can
          take to stay healthy or if it is too serious then what all treatments
          are recommended for it. As we all know to live a healthy life you
          should know your risk and what healthy lifestyle you can follow to
          stay fit. Our website and project can help you to build a powerful
          prevention plan with your healthcare team (doctors, nurses,
          pharmacists, registered dietitians, and other professionals).

      <h2 class="sub-h">Our vission for this project</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The reason why we choose this topic is because heart attacks/strokes
          are life-threatening medical emergencies, the quicker a person
          recognizes a heart attack or stroke, the better the chances of
          survival and a full recovery. It is important to understand the signs
          and symptoms of each to ensure immediate treatment and prevention. So
          our vission was to create a website where a person can get a detailed
          explanation regarding heart stroke, what all symptoms are there, how
          it is caused and the prevention steps that can be taken to stay
          healthy or if it is too serious then what all treatments are
          recommended for it. Thats why from our project we wanted to tell a
          person how likely he/she will get a heart stroke by predicitng it on
          the basis of some parameter it maybe caused. As we all know you should
          know your risk to live a healthy and long life.
