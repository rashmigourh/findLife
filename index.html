        <h3>About Heart Attack</h3>
        <p>
          A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely
          reduced or blocked. The blockage is usually due to a buildup of fat,
          cholesterol and other substances in the heart (coronary) arteries.
          <br />
          The fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits are called
          plaques.Sometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks
          blood flow. A lack of blood flow can damage or destroy part of the
          heart muscle.During a heart attack, a lack of blood flow causes the
          tissue in the heart muscle to die. <br /><br />
          A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Heart attack may lead to stroke since to work properly, your brain
          needs oxygen. Your arteries from heart delivers oxygen-rich blood to
          all parts of your brain. If something happens to block the flow of
          blood, brain cells start to die within minutes, because they canâ€™t get
          oxygen. This causes a stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of a stroke depend on the part of the heart that was
          damaged and the amount of damage done. Knowing how your heart works
          can help you understand your stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
          A heart attack is not the same as cardiac arrest, which happens when
          your heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. A heart attack can
          cause sudden cardiac arrest.

        <h3>Causes Of Heart Attack</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Age</b><br />
          Men age 45 and older and women age 55 and older are more likely to
          have a heart attack than are younger men and women.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>High blood pressure</b><br />
          high blood pressure can damage arteries that lead to the heart. High
          blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity,
          high cholesterol or diabetes, increases the risk even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Obesity</b><br />
          Obesity is linked with high blood pressure, diabetes, high levels of
          triglycerides and bad cholesterol, and low levels of good cholesterol.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Diabetes</b><br />
          Blood sugar rises when the body doesn't make a hormone called insulin
          or can't use it correctly. High blood sugar increases the risk of a
          heart attack.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Not enough exercise</b><br />
          A lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) is linked to a
          higher risk of heart attacks. Regular exercise improves heart health.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Unhealthy diet</b><br />
          A diet high in sugars, animal fats, processed foods, trans fats and
          salt increases the risk of heart attacks. Eat plenty of fruits,
          vegetables, fiber and healthy oils.

        <h3>Symptoms Of Heart Attack</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Chest discomfort</b><br />
          Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that
          lasts more than a few minutes or it may go away and then return.
          <br /><br />
          It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Discomfort in other areas of the upper body</b><br />
          Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back,
          neck, jaw or stomach. <br /><br />
          Heartburn or indigestion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Shortness of breath</b><br />
          This can occur with or without chest discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Other signs</b><br />
          Other possible signs include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or
          lightheadedness <br /><br />
          feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)br pain in other parts
          of the body, It can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest
          to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw,
          neck, back and tummy

        <h3>Prevention and Treatment</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Schedule a checkup</b><br />
          Find a primary care provider and see them at least once a year for a
          checkup or wellness visit. An annual checkup can catch many of the
          early warning signs of heart disease, including signs that you canâ€™t
          feel. These include your blood pressure, blood sugar levels,
          cholesterol levels and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Take your medications as prescribed</b><br />
          Seeing your healthcare providers regularly can help uncover
          heart-related issues or other medical problems you didnâ€™t know you
          had. This can also help treat problems sooner rather than later.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Exercise regularly</b><br />
          Aim for 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity five days a
          week.Your primary care provider can advise you on a healthy goal
          weight and provide you resources and guidance to help you reach that
          goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Eat a healthy diet</b><br />
          Examples include the Mediterranean or Dash diets i.e consume higher
          amounts of potassium â€” a heart-healthy mineral. You also consume less
          sodium, which can help lower your blood pressure and improve heart
          health.A plant-based diet approach is an excellent alternative.

        <h3>About Stroke</h3>
        <p>
          A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something
          blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the
          brain bursts. A stroke is similar to a heart attack, but it affects
          the blood vessels in the brain instead of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          To work properly, your brain needs oxygen. Your arteries from heart
          delivers oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your brain. If something
          happens to block the flow of blood, brain cells start to die within
          minutes, because they canâ€™t get oxygen. This causes a stroke. <br />
          The effects of a stroke depend on the part of the heart that was
          damaged and the amount of damage done. Knowing how your heart works
          can help you understand your stroke.
        </p>

        <b><p>There are two types of stroke:</p></b>
        <p>
          <b>Ischemic stroke</b> is most common form of stroke that occurs when
          blood clots or other particles block the blood vessels to the brain.
          Fatty deposits called plaque can also cause blockages by building up
          in the blood vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hemorrhagic stroke</b> happens when an artery in the brain leaks
          blood or ruptures(breaks open). The leaked blood puts too much
          pressure on brain cells, which damages them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="preview" data-target="p-6">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i>
        <h3>Causes Of Stroke</h3>
        <p>
          <b>High blood pressure</b><br />
          Your doctor may call it hypertension. It's the biggest cause of
          strokes. If your blood pressure is typically 130/80 or higher, your
          doctor will discuss treatments with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tobacco and Smoking </b><br />
          raises your odds of a stroke. Nicotine makes your blood pressure go
          up. Cigarette smoke causes a fatty buildup in your main neck artery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Heart disease</b><br />
          This includes defective heart valves as well as irregular heartbeat,
          which causes a quarter of all strokes among the very elderly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Diabetes</b><br />
          Diabetes damages your blood vessels, which makes a stroke more likely
          and the injury to your brain is greater.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>High cholesterol</b><br />
          Itâ€™s important to know if you have high cholesterol and is not managed
          it could lead to long-term health problems which could be serious. If
          you have high levels of cholestero your risk of stroke may increase by
          10%.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Gender</b><br />
          Women are slightly less likely to have a stroke than men of the same
          age. But women have strokes at a later age, which make them less
          likely to recover and more likely to die as a result.

          You can help prevent stroke by making healthy choices and controlling
          any health conditions you may have.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Choose healthy foods and drinks</b><br />
          Be sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. <br />
          Eating foods low in saturated fats, trans fat, and cholesterol and
          high in fiber can help prevent high cholesterol. <br />
          Limiting salt (sodium) in your diet can also lower your blood
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Donâ€™t smoke Cigarette</b><br />
          smoking greatly increases your chances of having a stroke. If you
          donâ€™t smoke, donâ€™t start. If you do smoke, quitting will lower your
          risk for stroke. Your doctor can suggest ways to help you quit.

          If you have certain heart conditions, such as heart disease or
          irregular heartbeat, talk with your health care team for medical

          <b>Control blood pressure </b><br />
          High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, so be sure to have it
          checked on a regular basis. Talk to your health care team about how
          often you should check your levels.
